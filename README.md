# My Portfolio
## Webpage Project
In the spirit of March Madness, here is my first webpage activity in which I created a basic webpage in my MITxPro Course. I am working towards a Professional Certificate in Coding.

## PacMan 
This project included two JS buttons which allowed me to create varrying sized pacMen that bounced around the screen upon selecting the Start Game button.

## Big Eyes
This project involved two eyes that tracked your mouse movement around the page.
